# Traffic-Pirate-Bot
automated bot for generating traffic in more of a 'black hat' way.

**Referencethe __README PDF__ for a better overview and a more in depth look into our project and all of its capabilities.**

THANK YOU FOR PURCHASING THIS TOOL and/or PARTICIPATING IN THE INFINATLY HELPFUL BETA PROGRAM. IF YOU HAVE ANY 
QUESTIONS YOU CAN REACH ME ON TELEGRAM @TP-Dev

Written in React.js and C# programming language.

Double click on the 'TraﬃcBotStartup1" ﬁle to set up dependancies and
	start the bot.

Once the main menu appears the rest is self explanatory.

Just follow the GUI prompts and ﬁll out the input information.

Click 'Deploy' to start the bot live.
	(OR)
Click 'Debug' to start the bot in a local environment for testing.
 (this is only needed to collect logs for submitting a bug report)

	{Tip}
• Make sure you do NOT include '@' in your Snap, Reddit or Twitter usernames. 

• The bot uses a free API library written by me to utilize 
   rotating proxies scraped with another bot I have hosted  
   in the cloud. When the bot calls this library, the function 
   may be blocked by windows or you may get a notiﬁcation 
   that has a 'Run Anyway' option. If you don't see that
   try 'More Info' then 'Run Anyway'. If Windows Defender
   blocks you from downloading the file then you either have 
   to turn off "Real Time Monitoring" or create a Window a 
   defender exclusion for the directory you download the file 
   to. Although those false positive triggers from your 
   anti-virus should have stopped since we got our licensing 
   issued, sometimes they take a little while for the next 
   update to get rolled out that includes our licensing 
   clearance.

When the menu asks, you'll need to enter your;

• Email list or email API. 

• Phone number list, or API.

• If you choose not to use the free proxies you'll have an 
opportunity to input your proxy list.

• Also you will need a CAPTCHA API or HCAPTCHA API 
depending on what platform you'll be automating.

At the time of this writing this bot currently supports; 

-Tinder
-Bumble 
-Badoo
-OKCupid
-Plenty of Fish
-Reddit
-Twitter

More platforms will be added as the beta process proceeds.

likewise some platforms will likely be removed due to patches.

This bot is free to use during beta testing but will be a paid 
service once we roll out the production version, but that's still 
a ways away! So Enjoy and Happy Pirating!
