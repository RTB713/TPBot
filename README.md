# Traffic-Pirate-Bot
automated bot for generating traffic in more of a 'black hat' way
THANK YOU FOR PURCHASING THIS TOOL. IF YOU HAVE ANY 
QUESTIONS YOU CAN REACH ME ON TELEGRAM @TP-Dev

Double click on the 'TraﬃcBotStartup1" ﬁle to set up dependancies and
	start the bot.

Once the main menu appears the rest is self explanatory.

Just follow the GUI prompts and ﬁll out the input information.

Click 'Deploy' to start the bot live.
	(OR)
Click 'Debug' to start the bot in a local environment for testing.
	   (this is only needed when submitting a pull request)

	{Tip}
• Make sure you do NOT include '@' in your snap username. 

• The bot uses a free API library written by me to utilize 
   rotating proxies scraped with another bot I have hosted  
   in the cloud. When the bot calls this library, the function 
   may be blocked by windows or you may get a notiﬁcation 
   that has a 'Run Anyway' option. If you don't see that
   try 'More Info' then 'Run Anyway' 

When the menu asks, you'll need to enter your;

• Email list or email API. 

• Phone number list, or API.

• If you choose not to use the free proxies you'll have an 
opportunity to input your proxy list.

• Also you will need a CAPTCHA API or HCAPTCHA API 
depending on what platform you'll be automating.

At the time of this writing this bot currently supports; 

-Tinder
-Bumble 
-Badoo
-OKCupid
-Plenty of Fish
-Reddit
-Twitter

More platforms will be added as the beta process proceeds.

likewise some platforms will likely be removed due to patches.
